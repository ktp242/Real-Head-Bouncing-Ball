[Real Head Bouncing Ball]
===================

[feb 4 2015 It's a test project for praticing the boilerplate.]

## Requirements
* [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [compass](compass-style.org)
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)

## Quick Start

* run `npm install -g grunt grunt-cli` (can skip if you've already got them installed)
* run `npm install` (you may need to do `sudo npm install` due to the execSync module)
* run `grunt serve` while developing (see below for info on `grunt serve`)


## Development Notes

A few quick reminders as you are developing.

* Absolutely no compiled files should be committed to git.  If a compiled file is showing in `git status`, add it to the ignore file.
* Use bower for all libraries accessible via git.  Using `grunt bowercopy:dev` or `grunt bowercopy:dist` will move those libraries' assets to the correct location.
* `bower_components` is an import path for SASS/Compass.
* Boilerplate contains Lodash and not Underscore or Lodash version of Underscore, so all [Lodash methods](http://lodash.com/docs) are available when required.
* [Accessibility checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html).
* [HTML5 Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list) on MDN

### Modernizr

Boilerplate has a custom builder of Modernizr that will allow you to add your own tests. Please update `Gruntconfig.js` with tests that are needed instead of loading the whole development version.  See [https://github.com/Modernizr/grunt-modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/grunt-modernizr) for more settings.

This approach will limit the Modernizr tests to only those needed for the project. As a benefit we prevent running every Modernizr test on every page load of the site.

## Grunt Tasks
All `:dev` grunt tasks are for local development and all `:dist` are used for distribution builds.

* `grunt bowercopy` - Moves files installed via `bower install` to their correct locations
  * `grunt bowercopy:dev`
  * `grunt bowercopy:dist`
* `grunt clean` - Cleans up the `.tmp` and `dist` folders
  * `grunt clean:dev`
  * `grunt clean:dist`
* `grunt compass` - Compiles Sass files tp `.tmp/cssgen`.  Sets import path to include `bower_components`
  * `grunt compass:dev`
  * `grunt compass:dist`
* `grunt concat`*
* `grunt concurrent` - Runs multiple grunt tasks at the same time to speed up builds
  * `grunt concurrent:dev` - Fires off nothing atm
  * `grunt concurrent:dist` - Fires off `imagemin:dist`, `svgmin:dist`, `cssmin:dist`, `htmlmin:dist`
* `grunt connect:dev` - Sets up a local server
* `grunt copy` - Copies all needed files to correct locations
  * `grunt copy:dev`
  * `grunt copy:dist` - copies over `robots.txt` and `favicon.ico` to the `dist` folder
* `grunt htmlmin:dist` - Minifies html files from `source` and saves to `dist`
* `grunt imagemin:dist` - Minifies gif, jpeg, jpg, and png from `source` and saves to `dist`
* `grunt jscs` - Checks all JavaScript to ensure it all matches standards set in the `.jscs.json` file
* `grunt jshint` - Checks all JavaScript to ensure code quality
* `grunt modernizr` - Builds out a lean version of Modernizr based on the settings found in `Gruntconfig.js`
  * `grunt modernizr:dev` - Compiles modernizr based on the `Gruntconfig.js`
  * `grunt modernizr:dist` - Compiles modernizr based on the `Gruntconfig.js` but uglified
* `grunt requirejs` - Runs through all JavaScript files and merges all dependencies to a single file.  *As the project grows, modules should be created to lesson the chances of have large JavaScript files*
* `grunt svgmin:dist` - Minifies svg from `source` and saves to `dist`
* `grunt usebanner` - adds a banner to the top of each file that is created*
  * `grunt usebanner:distjs` - adds a banner to JavaScript files
  * `grunt usebanner:distcss` - adds a banner to CSS files
  * `grunt usebanner:disthtml` - adds a banner to HTML files

\* Not implimented in `Gruntfile.js`
